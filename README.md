# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project uses historical data to predict sales using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to build a model that can accurately forecast future sales, helping businesses make informed, data-driven decisions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data for machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R² (R-squared) to evaluate model performance.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Akeem786/-Sales-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Sales_Prediction.ipynb
    ```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

## Dataset
This project uses a sales dataset in CSV format that contains historical sales data. The dataset includes the following features:
- Date
- Product ID
- Sales Units
- Price
- Advertising Spend

You can download the dataset [here](#).

## How to Use
1. Set up the environment and open the Jupyter notebook.
2. Run the cells to load data, preprocess it, and train the machine learning model.
3. Analyze the model's performance using the evaluation metrics.

## Model Performance
- **Linear Regression**: R²: 0.85, RMSE: 150
- **Random Forest**: R²: 0.90, RMSE: 130
