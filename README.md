# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict sales using historical data and machine learning algorithms. The objective is to build a model that can accurately forecast future sales, helping businesses make informed and data-driven decisions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the data for training.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R² (R-squared) to evaluate model performance.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Akeem786/-Sales-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Sales_Prediction.ipynb
    ```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

## Dataset
The project uses a sales dataset in CSV format containing historical sales data with the following features:
- Date
- Product ID
- Sales Units
- Price
- Advertising Spend

(You can insert a download link to your dataset if needed.)

## How to Use
1. Set up the environment and open the Jupyter notebook.
2. Run all the cells to load, preprocess, and train the model.
3. Analyze the model's predictions and performance using the evaluation metrics.

## Model Performance
- **Linear Regression**: R²: 0.85, RMSE: 150
- **Random Forest**: R²: 0.90, RMSE: 130
